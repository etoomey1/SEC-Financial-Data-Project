# SEC Financial Data Analysis Project
This project analyzes SEC Financial data sourced from the SEC's [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch). I built this project in order to analyze different financial statement accounts over time in various industries and companies. I wanted to practice my data cleansing and organizing skills in Pandas by joining several different datasets, concatenating data from several time periods, renaming and removing columns, adding new fields, and visualizing the data using pivot tables. I learned a lot by having to troubleshoot when I got stuck, such as when my joins weren't working due to different data types. Unfortunately, it took me until I was finished joining and cleaning the data to realize that there were problems with it that would restrict my ability to do the analyses I wanted. I imported my completed dataframe into Tableau and noticed that there seemed to be data missing from different accounts in different periods due to a change in the taxonomy used by the SEC to tag these accounts. This taught me the importance of checking the data in the beginning to make sure it will be sufficient to answer the questions you have or to display the desired visualizations. 
Overall I am happy with the work I did on this project. I was able to use skills I learned in Pandas and NumPy to manipulate my data, and it taught me valuable lessons that I will be able to carry on to my future projects.
